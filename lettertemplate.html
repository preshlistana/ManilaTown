			<h4 class="weighting-font">Dear Mayor Moscone,
        </h4>

<h4>Like thousands of people not only in San Francisco but across the country, I was appalled to hear about the mass evictions that have been occurring for years in Manilatown and at the I-Hotel. Echoing the requests of San Francisco community organizers, the following demands must be met to ensure that no one else will be evicted for the sole purpose of "urbanizing" a neighborhood:
</h4>

<h4>1. You must address the mass evictions occurring in Manilatown with the landlords of the area. </h4>


<h4> 2: The people who have been evicted must be given affordable housing in a safe neighborhood. </h4>
  
  <h4>3: Ensure that landlords to come have the necessary information regarding the events that have occurred.</h4>


<h4> 4. Create a policy to stop landlords from mass evicting the people that live there.</h4>

<h4> It is imperative that you condemn the actions of these landlords. Forced evictions for the sole purpose of development should not be happening. Too many people have lost their homes, and their community, and too often this happens in non-white communities such as Manilatown. This needs to end. </h4>

<h4> It is a tragedy that so many people of color have lost their homes. Landlords must be held to a higher standard than this. I trust that your office and the involved parties will do the right thing and end this. </h4>

<h4> "No Evictions! We Won't Move!"</h4>

<h4>Sincerely,</h4>
<h4>(first name, last name) from (city), (state)</h4>
