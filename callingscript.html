			<h4 class="weighting-font"> Community Member: Hello, I am a constituent of John V. Tunney and S. I. Hayakawa and would like to make a comment to Mayor George Moscone about the current issue in Manilatown. There’s many forced evictions going on to seniors in the area. They are not even given affordable housing to compensate for getting dragged out of their homes
        </h4>

<h4>Legislative Secretary: Certainly. I can transfer you.
</h4>

<h4>Community Member: Thank you. My name is (first name, last name), and I live at (full address). </h4>

<h4> I’m calling to urge Mayor George Moscone to oppose the forced evictions happening in Manilatown. This is not only an extremely important issue, this is a race issue. Not only is this happening in Manilatown, this is happening in other neighborhoods in San Francisco which are predominantly POC.</h4>


<h4> Legislative Secretary: I will give your message to Mayor George Moscone, would you like for him/her to send a response to you? </h4>
  
  <h4>Community Member: Yes, please send a response by letter at (full address) or by phone at (phone number). 
</h4>


<h4> Thank you for your time, </h4>

<h4> good-bye.  </h4>
